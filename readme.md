# SVD based watermark and Fourier transform based watermark system

This is a project of Digital Watermarking System, which is a homework practice of UCAS 2025 spring semaster Digit Secure Governance. In this project, we implemented two different watermarking systems: one based on the Fourier Transform (FFT) and the other based on the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

This repository contains two folders: `fourier_watermark` and `svd_watermark`. Each folder contains the necessary files for implementing a digital watermarking system based on the Fourier Transform (FFT) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
